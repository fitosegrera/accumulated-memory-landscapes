# accumulated-memory-landscapes

###Description

Accumulated-Memory-Landscapes is Inspired by Jim Campbell's “Accumulated Psycho”, a
piece which collects and interprets by averaging the monolith of cultural memory stored in
Hitchcock's film “Psycho” as specific, precise data, transforming it, staging it in present
experience; a transformation which devours memory, erasing its perceptual vividness by
literally overwriting it with fuzzy averages - condensations of computational memory.
Accumulated-Memory-Landscapes, as a conceptual process, explores how
technology can mediate and enhance human memory as a process; expanding the
possibilities of interaction, experiencing and sharing of these packages of information. This
workshop, rethinks the 3 main steps involved in human memory (Encoding → Storage →
Retrieval) by finding parallels between the biological human process and the technological
devices and algorithms used for capturing, storing and recalling data. Using a custom-made
electroencephalogram (EEG) with an embedded camera and internet access we have built a
wearable device able to measure attention levels (proven to be responsible in many ways for
memory capturing and retrieval) and alpha-waves patterns (used to measure visual cortex
activity) of a user, in any given moment. The device records significant moments of the wearer,
in the form of image sequences, which are sent in real-time to a server that algorithmically
processes these. The result is an immersive 3D procedural landscape built from these
memories; a space where the wearer and any other individual can experience and share (as in
the model of a social network) these accumulated memories in more spacial ways.


NOTE: ImageMagick NEEDS to be installed on the server
